# programming_demos

In this repo, you can find programming demonstrations for Data Science applications with the purpose of functioning as a personal portfolio and to help others learn some interesting concepts based on what I present.

For the most part, demos found here will be saved in two formats: a Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file and a Python .py file which can be opened in a source-code editor like Visual Studio Code under the same name for each.

Enjoy!
