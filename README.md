# Basic Pandas Demo

In this repo, you can find programming demonstrations for Data Science applications with the purpose of functioning as a personal portfolio and to help others learn some interesting concepts based on what I present.

For the most part, demos found here will be saved in two formats: a Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file and a Python .py file which can be opened in a source-code editor like Visual Studio Code under the same name for each.

In this demo you can find code showcasing some of the basic functions of the Pandas library along with a few visualizations that it can be used to create in conjunction with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Enjoy!
